  const [board, setBoard] = useState(/* 8x8 grid of possibilities */);
  const [currentPosition, setCurrentPosition] = useState(/* Where's the knight? */);
  const [validMoves, setValidMoves] = useState(/* Where can we go? */);
  
  // The classic knight move pattern
  const knightMoves = [
    [-2, -1], [-2, 1], [-1, -2], [-1, 2],
    [1, -2], [1, 2], [2, -1], [2, 1]
  ];
}
```
